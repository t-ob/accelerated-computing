<p>This website is a collection of notes in and around the topic of GPUs as a computation platform. Its existence is something of a forcing function for me to learn about and document this exciting and dynamic field. The intended reader is thus someone like myself &ndash; a software engineer with an interest in numeric computation at scale, with an appreciation for performance, who perhaps has been burned one too many times by distributed compute platforms and yearns for something better.</p>
<p>My hope is that one day they will form a cohesive and comprehensive text presenting an overview of a dynamic and changing field. In the meantime they will exist in a somewhat chaotic state, but I will try my best to provide a somewhat consistent narrative throughout.</p>
<p>The website and all of its contents are available on <a href="https://github.com/t-ob/accelerated-computing">GitHub</a>, and while not intended to be a collaborative effort, I am always happy to receive feedback.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-author">About the author</h3>
<p>I am a software engineer in London, UK. I&rsquo;ve been paid to write software (of varying quality) since 2012, though I have had an interest in computers from an early age, when my father, a head teacher, would (in a mild abuse of power) bring home one of his school&rsquo;s BBC Micros during the holidays.</p>
<p>My academic background is in pure mathematics, and I briefly pursued a career as a mathematician, with a half-finished doctorate in number theory to show for it (in hindsight, deciding to undertake a PhD because there was an ongoing global financial crisis &ndash; this was the late noughties &ndash; and job prospects were poor was always doomed to failure). While not destined for the ivory tower of academia, I have always been interested in the intersection of mathematics and computing.</p>
