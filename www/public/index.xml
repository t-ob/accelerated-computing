      <description>Today is the first day of the Fall 2, 2023 batch at the Recurse Center (RC), of which I am a participant.
For the unfamiliar, RC is (to quote from their home page) &amp;ldquo;The retreat where curious programmers recharge and grow.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m attending remotely from London, UK, for twelve weeks.
How I got here I left my job at Stripe at the start of the month. I&amp;rsquo;m proud of what I accomplished there, and how I grew as an engineer, but I came to realise that the kind of work I want to do &amp;ndash; the kind that energises me and gets me out of bed in the morning &amp;ndash; and the way the company is structured are just not compatible.</description>

      <description>This is the second incarnation of this website. My first attempt took the form (loosely) of an in-progress book about GPU programming, taking inspiration somewhat from algorithmica.org. While I would one day be delighted to write such a book, this format had some drawbacks, not least of which being that I am, in fact, not (yet) a subject matter expert, and (rightly or wrongly) I felt that I had no space to write anything but fully-formed and irrefutably correct things.</description>
