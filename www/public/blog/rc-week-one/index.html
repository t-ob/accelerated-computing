<h2>RC: Week one</h2>

<h3>18 September 2023</h3>

<p>
    <p>Today is the first day of the Fall 2, 2023 batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> (RC), of which I am a participant.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, RC is (to quote from their home page) &ldquo;The retreat where curious programmers recharge and grow.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m attending remotely from London, UK, for twelve weeks.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-got-here">How I got here</h3>
<p>I left my job at <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> at the start of the month. I&rsquo;m proud of what I accomplished there, and how I grew as an engineer, but I came to realise that the kind of work I want to do &ndash; the kind that energises me and gets me out of bed in the morning &ndash; and the way the company is structured are just not compatible. The core platform, computer-go-brr-shaped work I enjoy is largely concentrated on the US West Coast, while engineering outside the US is for the most part product-shaped (launch in new markets, support local payment methods, etc). I am painting a picture with very broad strokes here, so apologies to any former colleagues who read this and feel like I&rsquo;m not doing the org structure justice, but I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time writing about why I left, when what&rsquo;s ahead is far more exciting.</p>
<p>Time will tell if walking away from a stable, well-compensated job in this current climate will be foolish or not, but right now I&rsquo;m in the incredibly privileged position of being able to afford to take a bit of a breather from the daily grind of capitalism, so really, why not?</p>
<h3 id="how-im-going-to-spend-my-time">How I&rsquo;m going to spend my time</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot I&rsquo;d like to do in my twelve weeks! There are certainly a lot of <em>things</em> I want to learn, but at a higher level I want to re-learn how to push myself to do hard things, and to let myself get excited by computers again. I want to be asking myself, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#:~:text=%22How%20hard%20could%20it%20be%3F%22">&ldquo;how hard could it be?&rdquo;</a>, on a near-daily basis. Some ideas are a bit more fleshed-out than others, and I&rsquo;d like to allow for some space to be filled by serendipitous conversations, but so far the rough plan is as follows:</p>
<h4 id="aiml">AI/ML</h4>
<p>This is where I have the most fully-formed ideas of what to pursue. I&rsquo;d like to do some/all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete Andrej Karpathy&rsquo;s <a href="https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html">Neural Networks: Zero to Hero</a> course.</li>
<li>Implement a toy tensor library.</li>
<li>Implement some key, recent papers in the field.</li>
<li>Build an understanding of GPU architecture and programming.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compilers">Compilers</h4>
<p>My formal education was (many years ago now) in mathematics, and I&rsquo;ve been filling-in my computer science gaps over the years. One area I&rsquo;d like to get a bit more exposure to is the field of compilers (especially, how something like <a href="https://github.com/openxla/xla">XLA</a> works). I&rsquo;ve picked up a copy of Vladimir Keleshev&rsquo;s <a href="https://keleshev.com/compiling-to-assembly-from-scratch">Compiling to Assembly from Scratch</a> and Andrew Appel&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/ml/">Modern Compiler Implementation in ML</a>, and am going in with an open mind about an area I&rsquo;ve always taken for granted.</p>
<h4 id="cryptography">Cryptography</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in cryptography at a distance, and in the past have made some progress against the <a href="https://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals challenges</a> but never made it beyond set 2. If any of my fellow batch attendees are similarly motivated, maybe I can build the activation energy to push through to the later problem sets.</p>
<h4 id="writing">Writing</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a few attempts in the past to start a blog/personal website. Each time I&rsquo;ve talked myself out of it, usually out of some sense of fear that what I write will be wrong and mercilessly dismantled in the comments section of a Hacker News submission (I acknowledge also the implicit hubris assuming I&rsquo;d produce anything worthy of submission in the first place!). I know the myriad benefits writing brings, so I am declaring now that I will get over myself and just write, at least weekly for my time in my batch (and, hopefully, beyond).</p>
<h3 id="what-will-i-do-afterwards">What will I do afterwards?</h3>
<p>TBD! I have some optimism that the hiring market is in a bit of a better place than it was earlier in 2023, and the volume of recruiter messages I&rsquo;m getting on LinkedIn does seem to back this up. I&rsquo;d like to find myself somewhere doing something more AI/ML/Performance Engineering-shaped than my previous role. I&rsquo;ve also not ruled-out the idea of contracting. In any case, I&rsquo;m trying not to think too hard about this just yet, and enjoy the feeling of not having to think about work for a little while.</p>
