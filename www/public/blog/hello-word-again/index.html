<h2>Hello, world (again)</h2>

<h3>6 September 2023</h3>

<p>
    <p>This is the second incarnation of this website. My first attempt took the form (loosely) of an in-progress book about GPU programming, taking inspiration somewhat from <a href="https://algorithmica.org">algorithmica.org</a>. While I would one day be delighted to write such a book, this format had some drawbacks, not least of which being that I am, in fact, not (yet) a subject matter expert, and (rightly or wrongly) I felt that I had no space to write anything but fully-formed and irrefutably correct things. When I am learning something new, typically my thoughts and ideas are frequently incorrect and at best half-formed, so this was problematic.</p>
<p>So I am starting again, this time around in the more humble form of the Personal Website. The stakes feel comfortably lower this way &ndash; I am free to post whatever amateur hour material I like, in any order I like.</p>
<p>This is also well-timed &ndash; I will be starting in the Fall 2, 2023 batch of the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> later this month, and I&rsquo;m committing myself to learn in public as much as possible. My personal syllabus is somewhat loosely defined, but I am planning on going as deep as I can on contemporary machine learning and GPU programming. I&rsquo;m deliberately keeping things vague for the next week or two, to allow for space for serendipitous conversation to help steer things. I&rsquo;m committing to writing weekly updates, and my hope is that over time a coherent narrative will emerge.</p>
