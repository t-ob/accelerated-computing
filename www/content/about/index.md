Hello, I'm Tom. I am a software engineer in London, UK. I've been doing computer-related things professionally since 2012. Before then, I spent a couple of misguided years pursuing, then dropping-out of, a PhD in number theory.

I have worked across a few different industries, and varying levels of the stack. From iOS and machine learning at [long-dead][likely] [startups][lumi] (RIP, the dream of Silicon Roundabout), to building [systematic trading platforms][ahl], to global expansion and fraud detection at a [Silicon Valley fintech darling][stripe].

What I've come to realise is that the kind of work that energises me the most is that which sits somewhere within the overlap of mathematics and computer science. So I am staking out this corner of the internet to write about those things -- machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.

If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me by email at tom [at] [this-domain]. You can also find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin] and [GitHub][gh].
