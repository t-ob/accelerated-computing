<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    <p>Hello. I am a software engineer in London, UK. I&rsquo;ve been doing computer-related things professionally since 2012. Before then, I spent a couple of misguided years pursuing, and subsequently dropping-out of, a PhD in number theory.</p>
<p>I have worked across a few different industries, and varying levels of the stack. From <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/23/social-data-analytics-startup-likely-secures-1-6m-to-scale-up-offer-for-brands/">long-dead</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jul/11/last-fm-lumi-stiksel-miller-web-recommendation">startups</a> (RIP, the dream of Silicon Roundabout), to <a href="https://www.man.com/ahl">institutional finance</a>, to a <a href="https://stripe.com/">Silicon Valley fintech darling</a>.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve come to realise is that the kind of work that energises me the most is that which sits somewhere within the overlap of mathematics and computer science. So, then, I am staking out this corner of the internet to write about such things &ndash; machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. &ndash; and those things adjacent</p>
